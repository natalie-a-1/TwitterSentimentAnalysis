The data is primarily analyzed using textBlob's sentiment and polarity algorithms. The end goal of this project is to derive enough data over the controversial topic of abortion and use this information to study trends in public opinion. The data will be examined and cleaned to search for any conclusions that can be made regarding correlations to location, environment, political parties, age, sex, etc. Data will be gathered from individuals using query searches for relating topics and independant searches into the tweets posted by poltical figures in American polticial parties. </p>
