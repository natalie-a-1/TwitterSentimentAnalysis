# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
<h3 align="center">Project Description</h3>
<p align="center">This Project uses python to pull data from twitter using the v2 API. Libraries such as the ones listed below are used to analyze the text. The data is primarily analyzed using TextBlob's sentiment and polarity algorithms. This project takes in personalized queries and searches the most recent Twitter posts related to the query. The data is then cleaned and gathered in a way that it can be utilized for examination. Following this process, the cleaned data is analyzed by TextBlob for sentiment and polarity ratio. These findings can then be used to create visuals such as python DataFrames, WordClouds and sentiment/polarity plot graphs. </p>
