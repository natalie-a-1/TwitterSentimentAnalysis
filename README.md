# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
<h3 align="center">Project Description</h3>
<p align="center">This Project uses python to pull data from twitter v2 API. Libraries such as the ones listed below were used to analyze the text. The data is primarily analyzed using textBlob's sentiment and polarity algorithms. The end goal of this project is to derive enough data over the controversial topic of abortion and use this information to study trends in public opinion. I plan to examinate the cleaned data and see if any conclusions can be made regarding correlations to location, environment, political parties, age, sex, etc. Data will be gathered from individuals using query searches for relating topics and independant searches into the tweets posted by poltical figures in American polticial parties. </p>
